# NEEKU SHAMEKHI'S PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

## Description

This is a portfolio website created for my first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It is built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules of the course.

The purpose of this website is to provide information on who I am and what services I can deliver by providing my CV, and letting people to contact me.

I have tried to keep it simple. The website is split into 3 main pages:

- Home: An Introduction to me with links to my social media profiles.
- About: Information on who I am and what I do.
- Contact: A form to contact me for recruiting or any other purposes.
- There is also a link to a downloadable version of my CV.

## User Experience (UX)

This site is a personal portfolio for myself.

The page layout is responsive, with a mobile-first design in mind.

Background images are my own photographs captured out in the nature at different locations.

 The website has a left side vertical menu bar for larger displays which switches to a horizontal top navigation bar in smaller displays where the menu item names are hidden and only the relevant icons are displayed.

 The home page consists of my name and my occupation, along with a collection of social media icons that are linked to my profiles in various platforms. The purpose of this page to fulfill the user story:

 About page contains a short bio. To increase the text readability over the background image, especially when the device sizes change, I have dded a white opaq background so that it creates a contrast and makes the text more readable. The purpose of this page is to fulfill the user story:

 Contact page contains a contact form that allows the users to contact me through the website. The purpose of this page is to fulfill the user story:
